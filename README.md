# Wordpress Block Plugin Boilerplate

Plugin boilerplate for Gutenberg blocks developers.

This boilerplate is based on [Wordpress Create Block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/)  and [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate)

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder.

Then follow these steps:

* change `plugin_name` to `example_me`
* change `plugin-name` to `example-me`
* change `Plugin_Name` to `Example_Me`
* change `PLUGIN_NAME_` to `EXAMPLE_ME_`


* Install dependencies `npm i`


* Start plugin `npm start`

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Block Plugin Boilerplate uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the Boilerplate. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
